                    <h2>The Project Case Study</h2>
                    <h3>Significance of the problem </h3>
                    <p>One of the most frequent life changes in America is Moving. In a 2013 survey nearly a quarter of adults had experienced a move (Spayde, 2014). New residents are often hit with making many decisions all at once. Many of these decisions involve choosing a new service. Some services are better than others. Choosing the wrong service is a frustrating experience and can end in extra time and money spent. </p>
                    <p>
                        Companies that are well recommended online are likely to gain a significant increase in customers. It is a great value for businesses in the local area to increase customer access to information on services. Even companies that are not being reviewed may choose it as an opportune advertising spot to reach target customers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Stakeholder Needs</h3>

                    <p>
                        For the success of the New Resident Hub it is important to consider all the stakeholders surrounding the project. An analysis of each group will help in the addressing their concerns and interests.
                    </p>


                    <strong>Stakeholders</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New Residents</li>
                        <li>Residents that have used services</li>
                        <li>Established Residents that need to use a service</li>
                        <li>Local Businesses</li>
                        <li>Prospective Advertisers </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>

                        The first group involves the new residents to the area. These are the prime audience for the website. The new residents are looking for recommended services to use. They will need to be able to compare the recommendations on the site by easily viewing each result. Also needed are address and contact information clearly displayed. Residents that have used the services are another key group in making the website functional. Residents will be able to help others by giving their authentic opinion on the local businesses. This group of stakeholders need to be easily directed to the survey. The survey should be quick and easy for them to fill out. Questions should be written to be easily understood by those from multiple cultures, education levels and backgrounds. Established Residents that need to use a service can also benefit from the websites recommendations. If they have been using one service, but experience poor quality they can compare other similar services. These residents can find the best services in the area. </p>
                    <p>
                        When the site gains traffic and more use the local businesses will be impacted. The information of businesses on the site could affect them positively or negatively. It is important to make sure that all information about the company is presented accurately and up to date. There will also be a need for a section that contains contact information to the website managers. This way a business can make it known that there is a discrepancy to be fixed.</p>
                    <p>
                        There are also prospective advertisers to consider. They need the website to reach new residents. This means that the site must gain a steady amount of traffic visits. This can be done in two ways. First by attracting people to the website using SEO marketing. Then to keep people on to the website it must be easy to navigate and find the information that the visitors are searching the internet for.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Overview of Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        The design consisted of two pages. The first page will be the landing page. This page describes the purpose of the application and the name of the website. To the left of the description there will be there will be a logo. Below the description a button will take the visitor to the rest of the website. </p>
                    <p>
                        The navigation elements consist of the Home button at the top left and a log in /sign up button in the top left. The login/sign-up button will activate a popup window with a form. The form will ask for a username password and email with a submit button. At the very bottom is the contact e-mail for the website. The second page contains the same navigation menus to keep consistency. The next page contains sections of businesses with three survey questions and results cards. Below the business name will be a brief description of the business and will include contact information (See appendix A).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Successes and challenges of the pilot </h3>
                    <p>A wireframe and prototype help identify missing requirements for a site, design errors or even usability issues. It is so important to be the first step of the process because it reduces the errors in your product. It can also highlight the portions of the design that work. In this design, I think splitting the website into two sections works well. The first section gets you informed about the site and allows you to sign up for an account. The second page will focus on the function of the site. Scrolling to navigate through the business reviews will need to be enhanced. Some users will probably like the option of a button to navigate back to the top sections if the list is too long. </p>
                    <p>
                        Another challenge is submitting the survey. Users will be required to be signed in to leave vote. The modified design will include a pop up notification telling users to sign in or create an account to submit their vote when they attempt to submit while signed out.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Project Implementation</h3>
                    <p>The implementation of the project was broken down into five major milestones (See appendix B for WBS). The Design stage focused on creating the requirements for the project design. This was achieved through making a wireframe of how the project might look and act. The wireframe includes features that will be needed for function and usability. The screen states outline different views that the user will have while interacting with the website. The Design Documentation shows the design progress and any requirements stakeholders need. </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step was coding the first layers of the project. A minimal layout of the main application features was created to render the display of the review voting system. After the layout is complete the data of the questions, choices and answers were added into the database. JavaScript functions were added to retrieve the data to be displayed. Incrementing the votes and button functionality was added. Testing was done through the console to ensure proper functionality. Then documentation of the project and testing is started. Implementing further layout of the web app was added. This included adding the copy of the pages and the markup to display and organize the information. Added next were design elements that enhanced the site as well as an integration of features. These features included account creation and log-in, scroll to the top, privacy policy and voting restrictions. A test of the features functionality was done and adjustments were added. Security testing was done by scanning for vulnerabilities in the code.</p>
                    <p>
                        A staging environment was implemented for testing the performance of the website. The application was hosted on a secure server that allowed testing beyond the local environment. Multiple devices were tested for compatibility issues and performance issues.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing </h3>
                    <p>The process of developing a web application requires a considerable amount of time devoted to testing each aspect of the project. Much of the testing involved was functionality testing in which code was tested on whether it is behaving as expected (Zalavadia, 2017). Testing is done in small stages for each component of the website. This kind of testing is beneficial because if there is a code error it is easier to spot and take care of rather than waiting until the project is complete. Testing database functions on the server and client was done. All methods and events were also tested. During the functionality testing the console log was used to communicate to the server. Working though the code that was or was not returned showed what components were the issue. The sublime text syntax debugger was also helpful because it narrowed it down to both the file and sometimes the line of code. </p>
                    <p>
                        Compatibility tests were done to test whether the application worked in many different environments. The tests included multiple versions of chrome, safari, and Firefox. The responsive test tied a desktop size, a tablet size and multiple mobile sizes to assess. During the testing an inspection of whether the images were displaying properly and the text was readable. All interactive elements like buttons, events and pop-up windows were checked. Finally, a check that the layout of everything is the same or as expected. The results from the first text showed the mobile phones sizing to be too wide. Sizing adjustments were made to the layout and text. The second test showed sizing working properly. The text sizing was set larger for desktops and smaller text for mobile to avoid overlapping of elements. In addition to compatibility, testing was done on the accessibility of the page. The site was reviewed for sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, language declaration, page element identifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Performance tests recorded the rendering of the page. This was done through the chrome browser DevTools. The recording showed that the page started displaying around 3 seconds, but not until around 12 seconds was a substantial amount of the page load achieved. Adding a loading screen as priority and minifying js and css sheets only reduced the loading time to 11 seconds. The breakdown of the loading time revealed that the JavaScript files took the most time to render. Due to the different structure of a web application built mostly with Javascript extended loading times can occur. A couple of solutions can help optimize loading times after the development stage. The Javascript files can be deferred, compressed, or async tags can be added so that the DOM model rendering happens in parallel (Chishkala, 2016).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Security testing checked that the database is secure. Every project from the meteor framework starts out allowing to edit the database from the client to help early testing ( Meteor Development Group Inc., n.d.). To provide security this feature should be removed and manipulation of data should only be achieved through the server side. Next each snippet of code was scanned for any common known vulnerabilities. The scan revealed a vulnerability for a ReDos attack. A Regular Expression Denial of Service exploits common expressions by stimulating an extreme situation that causes it to work abnormally slow and leads to a vulnerability in the system (Hidalgo, 2015). The regular expression identified in this project was ms (a millisecond conversion unit) and was fixed through adding a length limiter to it. </p>
